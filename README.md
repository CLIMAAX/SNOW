### Launch a binder session

Binder sessions are not persistent and may not provide the necessary computing resources to run all workflow steps.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/climaax/binder-env/main?urlpath=git-pull%3Frepo%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252FCLIMAAX%252FSNOW%26urlpath%3Dlab%252Ftree%252FSNOW%252F%26branch%3Dmain)

### Local setup with conda

```bash
# Clone the workflow repository
git clone https://github.com/CLIMAAX/SNOW.git
